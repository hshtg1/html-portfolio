<h1>The Best Movies According to Mateusz</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Favourite Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>A really well-written movie. The story encompasses a life of mafia in a funny take on it. It's also an unexpected
    love story.
    It's just so satisfying to watch with many clever lines and an overlook on a thug life.

<h3>Ghost Story</h3>
<p>A beautiful movie that made me shed tears. Not many movies can do that. An artistic vision of grief and loss.</p>
<h3>Scream</h3>
<p>This brutal horror criminal movie is filled with unexpected plot twists.
    It's just so satisfying to watch. Scream is filled with horror movie references.</p>
<h3>Psycho</h3>
<p>One of the first horror movies that came to be. Made by the legendary Alfred Hitchcok,
    the story has a crazy major plot twist and many interesting quotes.
    Psycho is scary in it's own very original way. Many movies like Scream are modeled on it.</p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>Probably one of the best animations of it's kind. Shrek is a movie for everyone!</p>
